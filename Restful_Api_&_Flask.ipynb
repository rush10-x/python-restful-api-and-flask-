        "- RESTful API stands for Representational State Transfer API. It allows interaction with web services using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).REST APIs are stateless, meaning they do not store client context on the server, enhancing scalability.They enable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources, making them versatile for various applications.\n",

        "Q2. Explain the concept of API specification?\n",
        "- API specification outlines the structure and behavior of an API.It includes details about endpoints, request and response formats, and supported HTTP methods.Specifications often define authentication methods and error handling procedures.Common formats for API specifications include OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) and RAML, which help in documenting and standardizing APIs.\n",

        "\n",
        "Q4. What is routing in Flask?\n",
        "- Routing in Flask refers to the process of mapping URLs to specific functions or views.It allows developers to define how different endpoints respond to HTTP requests.Flask uses decorators to associate routes with functions, making it easy to manage and organize code.Routes can include dynamic components, enabling the creation of RESTful endpoints that handle variable data.\n",

        "Q5. How do you create a simple Flask application?\n",
        "- Start by installing Flask using pip. Create a new Python file (e.g., app.py) and set up a basic Flask application. Run the application, and it will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.You can expand the application by adding more routes and functionality as needed."
